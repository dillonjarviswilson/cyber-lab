Work In Progress - Many TODO's before can be used.

Cyber Lab is a classroom tool for teaching computing via the web browser (and cloud).

Cyber-lab utilises Docker to deploy virtual instances which can be accessed by the learners in the classroom via a web browser. The framework aids the creation of content, each lesson referred to as an activity. The system uses a rich GUI interface (activity workspace) to imitate a desktop-like environment for each student.
